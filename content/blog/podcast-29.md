### Quincy Larson - Teacher at @freeCodeCamp where you can learn to code for free

Quincy Larson was a school director for six years before he started to learn to code so that he could create tools for making schools more efficient. His own journey into learning to code was long and winding and he recognized the need for a single-track curriculum for newbie developers and that led to the creation of [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/).
