### Andre Garzia - Writer and Software developer

Andre is a writer and software developer. He is a hybrid author but favours self-publishing because owning your own platform is important and also because he secretly enjoys tinkering with ePubs. Andre published many non-fiction books focused on computer programming, and has been featured in a couple of Science Fiction and Horror short story anthologies.

Andre is originally from Brazil but now lives in the UK with his cat.
