### Brian Kernighan - Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University

From [⁠Brian's Wikipedia page⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan):

Brian Wilson Kernighan is a Canadian ⁠computer scientist⁠, he worked at [⁠Bell Labs⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) and contributed to the development of [⁠Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)⁠ alongside Unix creators [⁠Ken Thompson⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) and [⁠Dennis Ritchie⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie). Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the ⁠C programming language⁠ (⁠The C Programming Language⁠) with Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) ("it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work").[8] He authored many Unix programs, including ⁠ditroff⁠. Kernighan is coauthor of the [⁠AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK)⁠ and [⁠AMPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPL)⁠ programming languages. The "K" of K&R C and of AWK both stand for "Kernighan". In collaboration with ⁠Shen Lin⁠ he devised well-known ⁠heuristics⁠ for two ⁠NP-complete⁠ optimization problems: ⁠graph partitioning⁠ and the [⁠travelling salesman problem⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the ⁠Kernighan–Lin algorithm⁠, while the latter is known as the ⁠Lin–Kernighan heuristic⁠. Kernighan has been a Professor of Computer Science at [⁠Princeton University⁠](https://www.princeton.edu/) since 2000 and is the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Computer Science. In 2015, he co-authored the book [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.ca/Go-Programming-Language-Alan-Donovan/dp/0134190440).
